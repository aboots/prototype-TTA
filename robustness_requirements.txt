# Additional requirements for robustness testing with ImageNet-C style corruptions
# Install these in addition to the main requirements.txt

# Core corruption dependencies
scikit-image>=0.19.0
opencv-python>=4.5.0
scipy>=1.7.0
Wand>=0.6.7  # ImageMagick Python bindings

# For better progress visualization
tqdm>=4.62.0

# Note: You also need ImageMagick installed on your system
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install libmagickwand-dev imagemagick
# macOS: brew install imagemagick
# 
# If you have issues with Wand/ImageMagick, the basic corruptions
# (noise, blur, contrast, brightness, etc.) will still work, but
# motion_blur and snow effects will be disabled.
